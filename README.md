# Bash-Script-Repo
This repository contains all my Bash scripts as I learn and practice shell scripting in a Linux environment.

# How to Use
1. Clone the repository: git clone https://github.com/AJ-Projects-007/Bash-Script-Repo.git
2. Make the script executable: chmod +x script_name.sh
3. Run the script: ./script_name.sh

# Notes
1. Scripts are tested on Ubuntu/Linux Mint.
2. Some scripts may require root privileges (sudo).
